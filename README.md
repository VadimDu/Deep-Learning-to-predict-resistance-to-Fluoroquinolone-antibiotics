# Deep-Learning to predict bacterial resistance to Fluoroquinolone antibiotics
In this interactive tutorial we will preform machine-learning (deep learning) analysis of bacterial DNA gyrase/topoisomerase in order to predict resistance to Fluoroquinolones antibiotics. We will used Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based classifier to achieve it.
