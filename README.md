# Deep-Learning to predict bacterial resistance to Fluoroquinolone antibiotics
In this interactive tutorial we will preform machine-learning (deep learning) analysis of bacterial DNA gyrase/topoisomerase genes in order to predict resistance to Fluoroquinolones antibiotics. We will used Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based classifier from Python library of Keras (TensorFlow) to achieve it.<br/>To start the tutorial, click on the *Deep_Learning_to_predict_resistance_to_FQ_antibiotics.ipynb* which is a Jupyter Notebook interactive format (create this time using Google Colab).
