# Deep-Learning_to_predict_resistance_to_Fluoroquinolones
In this interactive tutorial we will preform machine-learning (deep learning) analysis of bacterial DNA gyrase/topoisomerase in order to predict resistance to Fluoroquinolones antibiotics. We will used Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based classifier to achieve it.
